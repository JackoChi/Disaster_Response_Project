# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

The first part is the Extract, Transform, and Load process. 

The second part is the ML traing.

The third part is the model deployment.

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`
